# GridBuilder
This project builds a simple 2D Array, and displays the contents as a Field.

The Player within this Field can move around the field, and the Window will clear and rebuild the Field to reflect this.

This was originally going to be a Maze Builder but I decided to make it a Grid Builder instead.
